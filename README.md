## Known Issues
```
[ Voxel is a Particle ]
Each voxel is a particle, we used particles to build the world!
Pros: higher performance on desktop and mobile
Cons: unable to remove shared faces, hard to manage particles

[ Max. 64,000 Voxel Particles ]
Unable to use the browser's local-storage after 64000 voxels,
this will affect the quick save and load, memory steps and
overall browser performance on desktop and mobile devices.
One possible option is to store data in chunks, but not
worth the complexity in a single html file.
Solution: use Bakery, 64000 voxels per bake!

[ Drawing on The Floor ]
It is possible to enable the floor drawing, but it makes
navigation more painful, especially on touch devices,
you may drawing instead of rotating the camera!
Solution: use New Floor to start with a floor

[ The Challenge ]
Minimum dependency, a single HTML file < 500KB!
```
